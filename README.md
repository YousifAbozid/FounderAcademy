## From the Video

The video highlights interviews from the nine startup founders who share their early journey in entrepreneurship and what motivated them along the way. Each founder had unique ambitions growing up, but eventually found their passion in running their own businesses and creating ideas. They discuss the importance of resilience in overcoming challenges faced by entrepreneurs and emphasize the need to have a clear purpose, target audience, and passion for their work. Many founders attribute their drive to a desire to help people, make an impact, and find innovative solutions to everyday problems. They also emphasize the value of learning from challenges, using them as opportunities for growth and development. Reflection, accountability, and staying focused on their passions play significant roles in their success as entrepreneurs.

In this learning module, you will explore the key driving factors behind your desire to become an entrepreneur and identify the support systems you have in place to help you succeed. By the end of this module, you should be able to articulate one key driving factor for your entrepreneurial journey and recognize the support systems that will aid you in overcoming challenges.

### Identifying Your Key Driving Factor

- Reflect on your motivation: To identify your key driving factor, spend some time reflecting on why you want to become an entrepreneur. Consider the personal, professional, and social aspects that contribute to your motivation.
- Analyze your passion: Determine if your entrepreneurial drive stems from a passion for your product or service, the desire to solve a problem, or the aspiration to make a positive impact on society.
- Assess your goals: Examine your short-term and long-term goals as an entrepreneur. Consider how your key driving factor aligns with these goals and contributes to your overall vision.

### Recognizing Your Support Systems

- Personal support: Identify the people in your life who support your entrepreneurial journey. This may include family members, friends, or mentors who provide emotional, financial, or professional support.
- Professional networks: Assess your professional connections and affiliations that can offer guidance, resources, and assistance in your entrepreneurial journey. This may include industry experts, business partners, or professional associations.

By understanding your key driving factor and support systems, you are better equipped to face the challenges of entrepreneurship and stay focused on your goals. Remember that your motivation and support systems will evolve as your business grows, so continue to reflect on and adapt to these changes to ensure long-term success.

## Common Frameworks

As you embark on your journey, here are some proven frameworks to consider adopting or referencing:

- **The Lean Startup Methodology**: This framework, developed by Eric Ries, focuses on creating a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) to test and validate business ideas quickly and with minimal resources. The Build-Measure-Learn loop helps entrepreneurs make data-driven decisions and pivot as needed based on customer feedback.
- **Business Model Canvas**: A visual template for developing and documenting your business model, the Business Model Canvas helps founders map out key components such as value proposition, customer segments, revenue streams, and cost structure. It is an effective tool for iterating and refining your business model over time
- **SWOT Analysis**: SWOT stands for Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats. By analyzing these factors, founders can identify areas of competitive advantage and potential challenges, enabling them to develop strategies for growth and risk mitigation.
- **SMART Goals**: SMART stands for Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. This framework helps entrepreneurs set clear, actionable objectives that can be tracked and assessed over time. Establishing SMART goals can facilitate focus, motivation, and accountability throughout the entrepreneurial journey.
- **The Five Whys**: This problem-solving technique, developed by Sakichi Toyoda, encourages founders to ask "why" five times to identify the root cause of an issue. By understanding the core problem, entrepreneurs can develop targeted solutions and make more informed decisions.
- **The Eisenhower Matrix**: This time management tool helps founders prioritize tasks based on their urgency and importance. By categorizing tasks into four quadrants (urgent and important, important but not urgent, urgent but not important, and neither urgent nor important), founders can allocate their time and resources more effectively.
- **GROW Model**: This coaching framework, which stands for Goal, Reality, Options, and Way forward, can be applied to personal and professional development. It helps entrepreneurs set goals, assess their current situation, explore possible solutions, and create action plans for achieving their objectives.

Remember that each founder's journey is unique, and the relevance of these frameworks and visuals may vary depending on your specific goals and circumstances. However, they can serve as useful starting points for early-stage founders seeking structure and guidance in their entrepreneurial pursuits.

## - Identifying the Problem

<a name="Identifying_the_Problem"></a>

[1.2 Identifying the Problem](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhJB-0P-vag)

## From the Video

The video is all about early-stage entrepreneurs who are in the process of identifying the problem they want to solve. In this video, different founders share their experiences of how they came up with their business ideas, which include personal experiences and market research.

The entrepreneurs highlight the importance of understanding customer needs and finding a problem that people are willing to pay for. They emphasize that a business idea should center around the customer and how they want the problem to be solved.

They also discuss the importance of solving a real problem that customers want solved, rather than simply pursuing a grand idea.

The businesses discussed in this video include a healthcare platform, a skin care company, a financial services provider, a taxi service, and a motherhood support network. Each founder has their own unique story and approach to identifying their business idea.

To identify customer demand, the entrepreneurs use a variety of methods, such as surveys, data mining, and talking to patients directly. They also discuss the challenges they faced, such as the lack of financial accountability for small businesses in Africa and the difficulty of accessing high-quality financial services for young Africans.

This video highlights the importance of identifying a real problem that customers want solved and using various methods to assess customer demand. It also emphasizes that entrepreneurs should be customer-centric and focus on understanding the needs of their target audience.

To go deeper, in this section we will explore three different methods of identifying problems that founders can use to select the specific problem they want to solve through technology and entrepreneurship.

- **Method 1: Personal experiences**
  - Many founders develop their business ideas based on their personal experiences or a tragedy they have faced. For instance, one founder in the video started a health tracking business after her father died from untreated diabetes. Founders can reflect on their personal experiences and identify the problems they faced or witnessed others facing. By doing this, they can come up with unique business ideas that solve real-world problems.
- **Method 2: Market research**
  - Market research is another method for identifying problems that entrepreneurs can solve. By analyzing market trends and consumer behavior, founders can identify gaps in the market and areas where they can provide a solution. Founders can conduct market research by talking to potential customers, analyzing competitors' products, and identifying unmet needs in the market. This method can help founders come up with ideas that are in demand and have the potential to generate revenue.
- **Method 3: Observing and empathizing with others**
  - Founders can also identify problems by observing and empathizing with others. By paying attention to the challenges that people around them face, founders can come up with solutions to address those challenges. This method requires founders to be empathetic and have a deep understanding of their target audience's needs. Founders can observe people in their daily lives, conduct interviews, and listen to feedback from their target audience to identify problems that they can solve.

Once founders have identified potential problems, they need to evaluate them and select the specific problem they want to solve. Founders can use the following criteria to select the right problem to solve:

- The problem should have a significant impact on people's lives.
- The problem should be something that the founder is passionate about solving.
- The problem should have a market demand, indicating that people are willing to pay for a solution.

In conclusion, identifying a problem is the first step in starting a successful business. By using personal experiences, market research, and empathy, founders can identify problems that they can solve. Once founders have identified potential problems, they need to evaluate them based on specific criteria to select the right problem to solve. With the right problem identified, founders can then move on to developing a solution that addresses the problem and meets the needs of their target audience.

## Common Frameworks

There are several common frameworks or visuals that early-stage founders can keep in mind related to problem identification:

- **Problem-solution framework**: This framework involves identifying a problem and then developing a solution to address that problem. The solution should be tailored to the needs of the target audience and should be feasible and financially viable.
- **Empathy map**: This visual tool helps founders identify the needs and wants of their target audience. The empathy map is divided into four quadrants: think, feel, see, and do. By filling in each quadrant with information about their target audience, founders can gain a better understanding of their needs and come up with solutions that address those needs.
- **SWOT analysis**: A SWOT analysis is a tool that helps founders identify their business's strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats. By conducting a SWOT analysis, founders can identify areas where they can capitalize on their strengths, address their weaknesses, take advantage of opportunities, and mitigate threats.
- **Value proposition canvas**: This visual tool helps founders identify their target audience's needs and come up with a value proposition that addresses those needs. The canvas is divided into two sections: customer profile and value map. By filling in each section, founders can develop a value proposition that meets their target audience's needs.

By keeping these frameworks and visuals in mind, early-stage founders can better identify problems, develop solutions, and create value for their target audience.

## Types of Business Models

But that’s not all - this learning module is designed to help you identify and articulate different types of business models, based on insights from startup founders in a video on establishing successful business models. By the end of this module, you should be able to identify which business model to pursue for your tech product or service.

Types of Business Models: There are several types of business models, and we will cover the following:

- **Advertising Model**:
  - This model involves generating revenue by displaying ads to customers. Examples of companies that use this model include Google and Facebook.
- **Subscription Model**:
  - This model involves offering customers access to a product or service on a recurring basis for a fixed price. Examples of companies that use this model include Netflix and Microsoft Office 365.
- **Freemium Model**:
  - This model offers a basic version of a product or service for free, with additional features available for a fee. Examples of companies that use this model include Dropbox and LinkedIn.
- **E-commerce Model**:
  - This model involves selling physical or digital products directly to customers through an online platform. Examples of companies that use this model include Amazon and Etsy.
- **Marketplace Model**:
  - This model involves connecting buyers and sellers on a platform and charging a commission on each transaction. Examples of companies that use this model include Uber and Airbnb.
- **SaaS (Software as a Service) Model**:
  - This model involves delivering software as a service over the internet, with customers paying a subscription fee. Examples of companies that use this model include Salesforce and HubSpot.
- **Platform as a Service Model**:
  - This model involves providing a platform for developers to build, run, and manage their own applications. Examples of companies that use this model include Heroku and AWS Elastic Beanstalk.

Identifying Your Business Model: To identify which business model to pursue, consider the following questions:

- What is the problem you are trying to solve?
- Who are your customers?
- How will you generate revenue?
- What is your unique value proposition?

Consider the costs associated with running your business, including hosting and product development. It is also important to test and iterate your product with customers to create a more effective and profitable business model.

Identifying and establishing a successful business model is crucial to the success of your tech product or service startup. By considering the types of business models available and answering key questions about your business, you can identify which business model to pursue. Remember to listen to customer feedback, iterate your product, and hire a proper accountant to manage finances and create a financial model that guides decision-making towards profitability.

## Additional Frameworks

Here are three additional frameworks that early-stage founders can keep in mind related to the topic of business models:

- **Revenue Streams Framework**: This is a visual framework that helps founders identify and evaluate different revenue streams based on their business model. It involves categorizing revenue streams into primary, secondary, and complementary sources. Primary sources are the main sources of revenue, while secondary sources are additional sources of revenue that complement the primary sources. Complementary sources are revenue streams that do not generate significant revenue but enhance the value proposition of the product or service.
- **Blue Ocean Strategy Canvas**: This is a visual tool that helps founders identify new market opportunities and create a unique value proposition. It involves mapping out the key factors that drive customer demand in a particular market, such as price, convenience, quality, and customer experience. By identifying areas where the competition is weak or nonexistent, founders can create a new market space, or a "blue ocean," where they can differentiate their product or service and capture significant market share.
- **Business Model Archetypes**: This is a framework that helps founders identify and evaluate different business model archetypes based on their industry and market segment. It involves categorizing business models into four main archetypes: transaction-based, platform-based, innovation-based, and efficiency-based. Transaction-based models involve one-time transactions between buyers and sellers, while platform-based models involve connecting multiple buyers and sellers on a platform. Innovation-based models involve creating new products or services, while efficiency-based models involve optimizing existing products or services to reduce costs.
- **Porter's Five Forces**: This is a framework for analyzing the competitive landscape of an industry. It involves assessing the bargaining power of customers and suppliers, the threat of new entrants and substitutes, and the intensity of competitive rivalry. By understanding these forces, founders can identify potential threats to their business model and develop strategies to mitigate them.

  - Bargaining Power of Customers: This force evaluates how much power customers have to negotiate prices and demand higher quality products or services. Early-stage founders should analyze their target market to determine if customers have a lot of bargaining power or if there are only a few customers who can dictate terms.
  - Bargaining Power of Suppliers: This force evaluates how much power suppliers have to negotiate prices and demand better payment terms. Early-stage founders should analyze their suppliers to determine if they have a lot of bargaining power or if there are only a few suppliers who can dictate terms.
  - Threat of New Entrants: This force evaluates how easy or difficult it is for new competitors to enter the market. Early-stage founders should analyze their market to determine if there are high barriers to entry, such as regulatory barriers or significant capital requirements, or if it is easy for new competitors to enter the market.
  - Threat of Substitutes: This force evaluates the availability of alternative products or services that can replace the product or service offered by the startup. Early-stage founders should analyze their market to determine if there are many substitutes available or if their product or service has unique features that make it difficult to substitute.
  - Competitive Rivalry: This force evaluates the intensity of competition among existing competitors. Early-stage founders should analyze their competition to determine if there are many competitors with similar products or services, or if they have a unique value proposition that differentiates them from the competition. By understanding these five forces and their impact on the business model, early-stage founders can develop strategies to create a sustainable competitive advantage and succeed in their industry.

By using these frameworks, early-stage founders can better understand their market opportunities, evaluate different revenue streams and business model archetypes, and create a unique value proposition that differentiates their product or service from the competition.

## Learning about Market Research

Market research is a crucial step in the development of any business. It allows entrepreneurs to identify gaps in the market and make informed decisions about the direction of their ventures. However, it can be challenging to know where to start when it comes to conducting market research. That's why understanding the different types of market research can help entrepreneurs determine which method they should pursue to inform the development of their minimum viable product (MVP).

The first type of market research is primary research. This involves gathering data directly from potential customers through surveys, focus groups, or one-on-one conversations. Primary research allows entrepreneurs to get first-hand information from their target market and gain a deeper understanding of their needs, preferences, and pain points.

For example, if an entrepreneur is developing a new software solution for small business owners, they can conduct primary research by reaching out to small business owners in their network and conducting one-on-one conversations or surveys about their current software usage and pain points. This can help the entrepreneur identify gaps in the market and determine what features their software solution should prioritize to meet the needs of their target market.

The second type of market research is secondary research. This involves gathering data from existing sources such as industry reports, government statistics, and competitor analysis. Secondary research provides entrepreneurs with valuable insights into the market, including industry trends, market size, and potential opportunities.

Continuing with the previous example, an entrepreneur developing a software solution for small business owners can conduct secondary research by analyzing industry reports on software usage in small businesses, government statistics on small business growth, and competitor analysis to see what features their competitors are offering. This can help the entrepreneur identify areas where their software solution can differentiate itself and fill gaps in the market.

The third type of market research is exploratory research. This involves gathering data to gain a general understanding of the market and identify potential opportunities. Exploratory research can include conducting interviews with experts in the industry or reading articles and publications related to the market.

In our previous example, an entrepreneur can conduct exploratory research by interviewing experts in the small business software industry or reading articles and publications related to small business software trends. This can help the entrepreneur gain a deeper understanding of the market and identify potential opportunities to innovate and differentiate their software solution.

When deciding which type of market research to pursue, entrepreneurs should consider their business goals, the stage of development of their venture, and the resources available to them. For example, if an entrepreneur is just starting and has limited resources, primary research can be a cost-effective way to gain valuable insights into the market. However, if an entrepreneur is further along in the development of their venture, secondary research can provide valuable insights into the industry and competitors.

Ultimately, the type of market research an entrepreneur pursues will depend on the unique needs and goals of their venture. By conducting market research, entrepreneurs can identify gaps in the market and make informed decisions about the direction of their business.
