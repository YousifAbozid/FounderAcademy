The Founder Academy is the first step with ALX Ventures, which helps entrepreneurs go from idea to impact. Whether this is your first startup, or you’ve already launched many before, the insights we’ll cover in this course is aimed to help you take your game to the next level.

You’ll hear from a number of amazing entrepreneurs who have built and launched their businesses across Africa and beyond. They’ve proven they can do hard things. Now it’s your turn.

The 3 themes of this course are: Think, Build, and Launch. You’ll hear stories, receive tips, and gain access to templates. From this you’ll need to submit 4 key deliverables to graduate from the Founder Academy and then move on to the next level.

We’ve also created specific videos that provide a deeper profile of each of the founders featured in the course, so that you can hear more about their stories. You can find them at the end in the bonus section.

The 4 key deliverables you will need to submit are:

- your business plan
- your prototype
- your pitch deck
- your video

We’ll share more specific guidelines on each of these deliverables later in this course.

Remember - becoming a startup founder can be one of the most exciting and rewarding experiences you’ll pursue in your life, but it can also be one of the most difficult tasks you’ll ever undertake.

We’re glad you’ve taken the first step towards enrolling in the Founder Academy, and we’ll be here with you along the way. Good luck!
